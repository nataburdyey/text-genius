## TextGenius

The `TextGenius` React app aims to generate paragraphs of placeholder text based on user input. It involves setting up a count state value using the `useState` hook, creating a `form` with a number input and a submit button, and importing a text array. When the user submits the form, the app extracts the first `n` paragraphs from the text array (where n is the count value) and displays them below the form. The paragraphs are rendered with unique IDs generated using the `nanoid` library.
